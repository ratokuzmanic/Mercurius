# Mercurius

Mercurius is a simple VMG message reading application that empowers users to view their old text messages in a chat format.

Goals
-----
Mercurius is created as seminar project for an [Object-oriented design class](https://nastava.fesb.unist.hr/nastava/predmeti/4564) I am enrolled at as part of my Computer science education at local college [FESB](https://www.fesb.unist.hr/). The main goal was to create a project that fits inside class requirements while remaining usable. I personally experienced need for a VMG reader/converter so I decided to address that problem by creating Mercurius. Mercurius enables you to read texts that date to _anno smartphone era_ by displaying them in a chat form of interface.

Story behind the name and the logo
----------------------------------
Application was named after Roman god [Mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(mythology)) whose original name in Latin transcribes to Mercurius. According to Roman mythology, Mercury was the patron god of messages and communication and since this application focuses on _anno smartphone era_ messages, it seemed reasonable to use the name Mercurius.    
The logo was inspired by planet [Mercury's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)) surface temperature that experiences the greatest temperature variation of the planets in the Solar System. Hence the half of the logo consist of warm colors while other half of cool colors.

Implementation notes
--------------------
Mercurius is implemented to meet Croatian localization needs but due to application's architecture and state of codebase, it can be easily extended if needed.     
Some of the high-level abstraction ideas that are implemented, more or less, include domain driven design concepts, object-oriented principles, design patterns and clean code guidelines.

Future ideas
------------
Mercurius could benefit from localization and adding UI configuration options but at this point of time there is no implementation plan for aforementioned.
